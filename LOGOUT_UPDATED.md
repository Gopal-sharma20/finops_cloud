# Logout Feature - Updated Implementation

## Overview
Added a logout button to all cloud dashboards (AWS, Azure, GCP) that clears user credentials and redirects directly to the **Connect Providers** page (not the initial onboarding page).

## New Page Created

### `/app/connect-providers/page.tsx`
A dedicated page for connecting cloud providers without going through the full onboarding flow.

**Features:**
- Clean, focused interface for connecting AWS, Azure, or GCP
- Shows connection status in real-time
- "Continue to Dashboard" button appears after connecting at least one provider
- "Back to Onboarding" button for users who want the full flow
- Stores credentials in localStorage
- Auto-redirects to appropriate dashboard after connection

**Route:** `http://localhost:3000/connect-providers`

## Updated Logout Flow

### Before (Initial Implementation)
```
[Logout] → /onboarding (full onboarding flow)
```

### After (Current Implementation)
```
[Logout] → /connect-providers (direct to provider connection)
```

### User Experience:
1. User clicks **Logout** button
2. Credentials cleared from localStorage
3. Redirected to `/connect-providers` page
4. User sees cloud provider connection cards (AWS, Azure, GCP)
5. User can reconnect to any provider immediately
6. After connecting, clicks "Continue to Dashboard"
7. Redirected to appropriate cloud dashboard

## Benefits of Direct Connect Page

1. **Faster Reconnection**: Skip role selection and preferences
2. **Multiple Accounts**: Easy to switch between different cloud accounts
3. **Focused Task**: User knows exactly what to do (connect providers)
4. **Flexible**: Can still go back to full onboarding if needed
5. **Professional**: Mimics enterprise SaaS behavior

## Files Modified

### Dashboard Files
All three dashboards updated to redirect to `/connect-providers`:

1. `/app/clouds/aws/page.tsx`
   ```typescript
   const handleLogout = () => {
     logout()
     router.push("/connect-providers")  // Changed from "/onboarding"
   }
   ```

2. `/app/clouds/azure/page.tsx`
3. `/app/clouds/gcp/page.tsx`

### Logout Utility
No changes needed to `/lib/auth/logout.ts` - it still clears all credentials properly.

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. Navigate to any cloud dashboard (AWS/Azure/GCP)
2. Click "Logout" button in top right
3. **Verify**: Redirected to `/connect-providers` (NOT `/onboarding`)
4. See cloud provider connection cards
5. Enter credentials for AWS, Azure, or GCP
6. Click "Continue to Dashboard"
7. Verify redirect to appropriate dashboard

### Direct Access
You can also access the connect providers page directly:
- URL: `http://localhost:3000/connect-providers`
- Useful for quick reconnection or switching accounts

## Comparison: Logout Destinations

### Option 1: Full Onboarding Flow (Previous)
```
Logout → /onboarding
  ├─ Welcome screen
  ├─ Role selection (CFO/CTO/DevOps/etc.)
  ├─ Connect providers ← User wants to be here
  ├─ Preferences setup
  └─ Complete
```
❌ Too many steps for reconnection
❌ Unnecessary for account switching

### Option 2: Direct Connect (Current) ✅
```
Logout → /connect-providers
  └─ Connect providers ← User immediately here
```
✅ One-click to reconnection
✅ Perfect for switching accounts
✅ Still accessible from onboarding flow

## Routes Summary

| Route | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/onboarding` | Full onboarding flow | New users, first-time setup |
| `/connect-providers` | Quick provider connection | After logout, switching accounts |
| `/clouds/aws` | AWS Dashboard | After connecting AWS |
| `/clouds/azure` | Azure Dashboard | After connecting Azure |
| `/clouds/gcp` | GCP Dashboard | After connecting GCP |

## Future Enhancements

- Add "Switch Account" button (logout + reconnect in one click)
- Show previously connected providers
- Allow multiple account profiles per provider
- Quick reconnect with last used credentials (encrypted)
- Provider health check before redirect
