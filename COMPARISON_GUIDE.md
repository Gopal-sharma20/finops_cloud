# üé® Real vs Mock Data Comparison Guide

## üìã Quick Access URLs

### For Side-by-Side Comparison:

**Open these two URLs in separate browser windows:**

1. **Real AWS Data:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/clouds/aws
   ```

2. **Mock Data (for comparison):**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/clouds/aws-mock
   ```

---

## üîç How to Compare

### Step-by-Step Comparison Process:

1. **Open Two Browser Windows Side-by-Side**
   - Left window: Real AWS dashboard (`/clouds/aws`)
   - Right window: Mock AWS dashboard (`/clouds/aws-mock`)

2. **Open Developer Console in Both (F12)**
   - Look for console messages to confirm data source
   - Real data shows: `‚úÖ Using REAL cost data`
   - Mock data shows: `üé≠ MOCK DATA PAGE - Using only mock data`

3. **Compare Each Section:**
   - Account ID badge (top right)
   - Total cost display
   - Services list
   - Regional breakdown
   - Recommendations

## üìä Key Differences to Notice

### 1. Account ID Badge (Top Right)

| Real Data | Mock Data |
|-----------|-----------|
| Shows: **428055055471** | Shows: **MOCK-ACCOUNT** |
| Your actual AWS account ID | Placeholder text |

### 2. Total Monthly Cost

| Real Data | Mock Data |
|-----------|-----------|
| $86.56 | $91,500 |
| Actual AWS spend from Cost Explorer | Large fake number |
| Updates when you click Refresh | Never changes |

### 3. Service Breakdown (Overview Tab)

**Real Data:**
- Shows 5-6 actual services you're using
- Services: EC2 Compute ($51.50), EC2 Other ($27.43), VPC ($3.76), S3 ($0.10), Tax ($3.16)
- Dynamic based on actual usage
- Only shows services with costs > $0

**Mock Data:**
- Always shows 8 hardcoded services
- Services: EC2 ($18,240), S3 ($12,890), RDS ($8,750), etc.
- Same every time
- Fake large costs

### 4. Regional Costs (Overview Tab)

**Real Data:**
- Shows only regions where you actually have spend
- Real per-region costs from AWS Cost Explorer
- Example: "US East (N. Virginia): $45.23"
- Mumbai (ap-south-1) only appears if you have spend there
- Can show 1-33 regions depending on usage

**Mock Data:**
- Always shows 8 hardcoded regions
- Regions: US East ($28,450), US West ($18,920), Europe ($15,650), etc.
- Same regions every time
- Fake large costs

### 5. Resources Tab

**Real Data:**
- Shows actual AWS services you're using
- Real costs per service
- Icons match service types (Server, Database, etc.)

**Mock Data:**
- Shows 8 hardcoded services
- All services always present
- Fake utilization percentages

### 6. Recommendations Tab

**Real Data:**
- Based on actual AWS audit findings
- Real stopped EC2 instances in your account
- Real unattached EBS volumes
- Real unassociated Elastic IPs
- Actual savings calculations
- Example: "Instance i-0abc123 has been stopped. Consider terminating if no longer needed."

**Mock Data:**
- 4 generic recommendations
- Fake resource IDs
- Examples: "Right-size EC2 instances", "Delete unused S3 buckets"
- Same recommendations every time

### 7. Costs Tab

**Real Data:**
- Cost trends based on actual total cost ($86.56)
- Forecast and optimized projections scale with real costs
- Updates when you click Refresh

**Mock Data:**
- Cost trends based on fake cost ($91,500)
- Large fake numbers throughout
- Never changes

### 8. Utilization Tab

**Both show generated data:**
- CPU, Memory, Network trends
- 24-hour visualization
- This data is generated/simulated in both versions

## üñ•Ô∏è Browser Console Comparison

### Real Data Console (`/clouds/aws`):
```javascript
‚úÖ Using REAL cost data: {
  profileName: "default",
  accountId: "428055055471",
  periodStartDate: "2024-12-10",
  periodEndDate: "2025-01-10",
  totalCost: 86.56,
  costByService: {
    "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute": 51.50,
    "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Other": 27.43,
    "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud": 3.76,
    "Amazon Simple Storage Service": 0.10,
    "Tax": 3.16
  },
  status: "success"
}

‚úÖ Using REAL regional cost data: {
  "us-east-1": 45.23,
  "us-west-2": 22.15,
  "ap-south-1": 12.45,
  "eu-west-1": 6.73
}
```

### Mock Data Console (`/clouds/aws-mock`):
```javascript
üé≠ MOCK DATA PAGE - Using only mock data for comparison
üé≠ Using MOCK services data
üé≠ Using MOCK regions data
üé≠ Using MOCK recommendations data
üé≠ Using MOCK cost trends data
```

## üì∏ Screenshot Comparison Areas

### Take screenshots of these sections in both dashboards:

1. **Header with Account Badge**
   - Shows the most obvious difference (real account ID vs "MOCK-ACCOUNT")

2. **Overview Tab - Service Pie Chart**
   - Real: 5-6 slices with small costs
   - Mock: 8 slices with large costs

3. **Overview Tab - Regional Table**
   - Real: Variable number of regions with actual costs
   - Mock: Always 8 regions with large fake costs

4. **Recommendations Tab**
   - Real: Specific audit findings with real resource IDs
   - Mock: Generic recommendations with fake IDs

---

## üé¨ Interactive Comparison Steps

### Try These Actions:

1. **Click Refresh Button:**
   - Real data: Fetches latest from AWS, numbers may change
   - Mock data: Console logs "MOCK: Refresh button clicked", no change

2. **Select a Region Filter:**
   - Real data: Shows only that region's real costs
   - Mock data: Shows that region's fake costs

3. **Select a Service Filter:**
   - Real data: Shows only services you actually use
   - Mock data: Shows hardcoded services

4. **Check Recommendations:**
   - Real data: Click "Apply" (would execute real actions)
   - Mock data: Click "Apply" (cosmetic only)

## üìä Data Source Summary

### Real Data Sources (`/clouds/aws`):
- AWS Cost Explorer API (GetCostAndUsage with GroupBy: SERVICE)
- AWS Cost Explorer API (GetCostAndUsage with GroupBy: REGION)
- AWS EC2 API (DescribeInstances for stopped instances)
- AWS EBS API (DescribeVolumes for unattached volumes)
- AWS EC2 API (DescribeAddresses for unassociated EIPs)
- AWS STS API (GetCallerIdentity for account ID)

**Total API Cost:** ~$0.02 per page load

### Mock Data Sources (`/clouds/aws-mock`):
- Hardcoded JavaScript arrays
- No API calls
- No AWS SDK usage
- Free (no cost)

---

## üî¨ Technical Comparison

### Real Data Page Architecture:
```
React Component
   ‚Üì
useProfileCost() hook
   ‚Üì
React Query (TanStack Query)
   ‚Üì
API Route: /api/aws/cost
   ‚Üì
AWS SDK v3
   ‚Üì
AWS Cost Explorer API
   ‚Üì
Transform Functions
   ‚Üì
UI Components (Charts, Tables, etc.)
```

### Mock Data Page Architecture:
```
React Component
   ‚Üì
useMemo() hooks
   ‚Üì
Hardcoded Mock Data Arrays
   ‚Üì
UI Components (Same as real!)
```

**Key Difference:** Mock page skips all API calls but uses identical UI components!

## üéØ Why Both Versions Exist

### Real Data Dashboard (`/clouds/aws`):
- **Production use** - Shows actual AWS costs
- **Cost tracking** - Monitor real spending
- **Audit findings** - Identify waste
- **Recommendations** - Take action on real resources
- **Requires AWS credentials**

### Mock Data Dashboard (`/clouds/aws-mock`):
- **Demonstrations** - Show UI without AWS access
- **Testing** - Verify UI works without API
- **Comparisons** - Side-by-side with real data
- **Development** - Work on UI without AWS calls
- **No AWS credentials required**
