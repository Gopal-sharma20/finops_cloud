# Logout Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a logout button to all cloud dashboards (AWS, Azure, GCP) that clears user credentials and redirects to the onboarding/connection page.

## Files Created

### 1. `/lib/auth/logout.ts`
Central logout utility module with three functions:

- **`logout()`**: Clears all CloudOptima localStorage items
  - `cloudoptima-onboarding`
  - `cloudoptima-user-role`
  - `cloudoptima-aws-profile`
  - `cloudoptima-azure-profile`
  - `cloudoptima-gcp-profile`

- **`isLoggedIn()`**: Checks if user has onboarding data

- **`getConnectedProviders()`**: Returns array of connected cloud providers

## Files Modified

### 1. AWS Dashboard (`/app/clouds/aws/page.tsx`)
- Added `useRouter` from next/navigation
- Added `LogOut` icon from lucide-react
- Imported `logout` utility
- Added `handleLogout` function
- Added Logout button with red hover effect

### 2. Azure Dashboard (`/app/clouds/azure/page.tsx`)
- Same changes as AWS dashboard
- Consistent styling with blue theme

### 3. GCP Dashboard (`/app/clouds/gcp/page.tsx`)
- Same changes as AWS/Azure dashboards
- Consistent styling with green theme

## UI/UX Features

### Button Styling
```tsx
<Button 
  variant="outline" 
  size="sm" 
  onClick={handleLogout} 
  className="hover:bg-red-50 hover:text-red-600 hover:border-red-300"
>
  <LogOut className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Logout
</Button>
```

### Visual Feedback
- Default: Outline button with subtle styling
- Hover: Red background tint, red text, red border
- Icon: LogOut icon from lucide-react
- Position: Right-most button in header

### Button Order (left to right)
1. Refresh/Sync
2. Export
3. Configure (with gradient background)
4. **Logout** (new)

## Functionality

### Logout Flow
1. User clicks Logout button
2. `handleLogout()` is called
3. `logout()` clears all localStorage data
4. Console logs: "✅ Logged out successfully - cleared all credentials"
5. Router navigates to `/onboarding`
6. User sees connection/onboarding flow

### Connection Page
- Path: `/onboarding`
- Component: `OnboardingFlow`
- User can reconnect to cloud providers
- Credentials stored back to localStorage on completion

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps
1. Navigate to any cloud dashboard (AWS/Azure/GCP)
2. Click the "Logout" button in the top right
3. Verify console shows logout message
4. Confirm redirect to `/onboarding` page
5. Check localStorage is cleared (F12 > Application > Local Storage)
6. Complete onboarding again to test reconnection

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Logout button visible on all dashboards
- ✅ Red hover effect on button
- ✅ Credentials cleared from localStorage
- ✅ Redirect to onboarding page
- ✅ Can reconnect after logout

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Users can properly sign out and clear credentials
2. **Multi-Account**: Easy switching between different cloud accounts
3. **User Control**: Clear, visible logout option
4. **Consistent UX**: Same behavior across all dashboards
5. **Visual Clarity**: Red hover indicates "exit" action

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Confirmation dialog before logout
- "Switch Account" option without full logout
- Remember last connected provider
- Session timeout with auto-logout
- Logout from all tabs/windows simultaneously
