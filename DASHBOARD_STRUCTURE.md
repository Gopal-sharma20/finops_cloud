# Dashboard Structure Clarification

## Current Dashboard Layout

### 1. Cloud-Specific Dashboards (Provider View)
These show resources and costs for a specific cloud provider:

- **`/clouds/aws`** - AWS Cloud Dashboard
  - EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions
  - AWS-specific services and regions
  - AWS Cost Explorer data
  
- **`/clouds/azure`** - Azure Cloud Dashboard ✅
  - VMs, Storage accounts, Functions
  - Azure-specific services and regions  
  - Azure Cost Management data

- **`/clouds/gcp`** - GCP Cloud Dashboard
  - Compute instances, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions
  - GCP-specific services and regions
  - GCP BigQuery cost data

### 2. Role-Based Dashboards (Executive View)
These show multi-cloud aggregated data for specific roles:

- **`/dashboard/cfo`** - CFO Executive Dashboard
  - Multi-cloud cost overview (AWS + Azure + GCP)
  - Budget scenario planning
  - Vendor risk analysis
  - Financial metrics and forecasts
  - Board-ready reports

- **`/dashboard/cto`** - CTO Dashboard
  - Technical architecture view
  - Multi-cloud tech stack
  
- **`/dashboard/devops`** - DevOps Dashboard
  - Operations and efficiency metrics

## What Got Fixed

### Before Fix:
```
User connects Azure → Redirected to /dashboard/cfo ❌
```
This showed multi-cloud CFO view instead of Azure-specific view

### After Fix:
```
User connects Azure → Redirected to /clouds/azure ✅
```
This shows Azure-specific cloud dashboard

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Cloud Engineer Managing Azure
**Route:** `/clouds/azure`
**Purpose:** Deep dive into Azure resources, costs by service, regional distribution
**Data:** Azure-only

### Scenario 2: CFO Reviewing Company Cloud Spend
**Route:** `/dashboard/cfo`
**Purpose:** Financial overview across all clouds, budget planning, executive reporting
**Data:** AWS + Azure + GCP combined

## File Structure

```
app/
├── clouds/
│   ├── aws/page.tsx        ← AWS-specific dashboard
│   ├── azure/page.tsx      ← Azure-specific dashboard ✅ Already complete
│   └── gcp/page.tsx        ← GCP-specific dashboard
│
└── dashboard/
    ├── cfo/page.tsx        ← Multi-cloud CFO view (stays here)
    ├── cto/page.tsx        ← Multi-cloud CTO view
    └── devops/page.tsx     ← Multi-cloud DevOps view
```

## Current Status

✅ `/clouds/azure` - **Complete and functional**
  - Has Azure-specific content
  - Shows Azure services, regions, costs
  - Uses Azure Cost Management API
  - Logout button redirects correctly

✅ `/dashboard/cfo` - **Stays as multi-cloud view**
  - Shows aggregated data from all providers
  - Used by financial executives
  - Separate purpose from cloud dashboards

## Summary

**No content needs to be moved!** 

Both dashboards exist and serve different purposes:
- Azure dashboard is for Azure cloud engineers/admins
- CFO dashboard is for financial executives viewing all clouds

The routing issue has been fixed - Azure users now go to `/clouds/azure` automatically.
